					cross, you have to further go down for 4-5 kms. Two wheelers go down
					to a certain point ( 2 kms, land mark is a House ) but, the road is terrible.
					After you reach the landmark, you have to pay rupees 10 in the house
					and go further. After 5-10 minutes of walk, you will get the falls, you
