        <p>
			<b>Jog Falls</b> is a waterfall on the Sharavati river located in the Western Ghats
			of Sagar Taluk of Shivamogga District, Karnataka, India. It is the third
			highest plunge waterfall in India. It is a segmented waterfall which depends
			on rain and season becomes a plunge waterfall. The falls are major
			attractions for tourists and is ranked 36th in the list of free-falling waterfalls,
			490th in the world by list of waterfalls by total height, 128th in the list of
			single-drop waterfalls in the World by the waterfall database.
		</p>

		<p>Jog Falls is created by the Sharavati dropping 253 m (830 ft), making it the
			third-highest waterfall in India after the Nohkalikai Falls with a drop of
			335 m (1,099 ft) in Meghalaya[11] and the Dudhsagar Falls with a drop of
			310 m (1,020 ft) in Goa.
		</p>
		
		<p>Sharavathi, a river which rises at Ambutirtha, next to Nonabur, in
			the Thirthahalli taluk takes a northwesterly course by Fatte petta, receives
			the Haridravati on the right below Pattaguppe and the Yenne Hole on the
			left above Barangi. Then, it bends to the west, precipitates itself down the
			Jog Falls (aka Gersoppa Falls), and passes the village of Gersoppa (properly
			Geru-Sappe), which is some 30 kilometres (19 mi) away, discharging into
			the Arabian Sea at Honnavar in Uttara Kannada.</p>

			<p>The Sharavathi, flowing over a very rocky bed about 250 yards (230 m)
				wide, reaches a tremendous chasm, 290 m (950 ft) deep, and the water
				comes down in four distinct falls, Raja, Rani, Roarer and Rocket.[13] The
				Raja Fall comes down in one unbroken column sheer to the depth of 250 m
				(830 ft). Halfway down, it is encountered by the Roarer, which precipitates
				itself into a vast cup and then rushes violently downwards to meet the Raja.
				The Rocket shoots downwards in a series of jets. The Rani moves quietly
				over the mountainside in a sheet of foam. The Tourism Department has built
				steps from the viewpoint at the top, where the waterfall can be seen from
				across, to the bottom of the hill. There are approximately 1,400 steps made
				to reach the bottom of the hill.

		<h3>
			<b>Significance</b>
		</h3>

			<p>Associated with the waterfall is the nearby Linganamakki Dam across
				the Sharavati River. The power station has been operational since 1948 and
				is of 120 MW capacity, one of the largest hydroelectric stations in India at
				that time and a small source of electric power for Karnataka now. The power
				station was previously named Krishna Rajendra hydro-electric project, after
				the King of Mysore at that time. The name was later changed to Mahatma
				Gandhi Hydro-electric Project. It was served by The Hirebhaskara dam until
				1960. After 1960, due to the ideas of Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya,
				Linganmakki Dam has been used for power generation.
