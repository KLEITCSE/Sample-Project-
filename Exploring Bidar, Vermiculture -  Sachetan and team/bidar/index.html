                <h4>Crown of Karnataka</h4>
                <p>Bidar is a city in the north-eastern part of Karnataka state in India. It is the headquarters of Bidar District which borders Maharashtra and Telangana. The city is well known for its many sites of architectural, historical, and religious
                    importance.
                </p><br>
                <p>Being located at the farthest of around 700 km (430 mi) from the state capital Bangalore, it has been neglected by the state government for a long time. However, owing to its rich heritage, the city has a prominent place on the Archaeological
                    Map of India. Picturesquely perched on the Deccan plateau, the Bidar fort is more than 500 years old and still standing strong. According to the book "Bidar Heritage" published by the state Department of Archaeology, Museums, and Heritage,
                    of the 61 monuments listed by the department, about 30 are tombs located in and around Bidar city., explaining its nickname, "City of Whispering Monuments".
                </p><br>

                <p>Bidar is home to the second-biggest Indian Air Force training center in the country. The IAF Station Bidar is used for advanced jet training of prospective fighter pilots on BAe Hawk aircraft. Bidar city is known for its Bidri handicraft
                    products, and its rich history. Bidar is also considered one of the holiest places for Sikh pilgrimage. Unlike other places in the region, Bidar is the coldest and wettest place in north Karnataka.
                </p><br>
                <p>Geographically, it is surrounded by Kalaburagi district on the southern side, Telangana State on the eastern side and Maharashtra State on the western and the northern side. Bidąr is Karnataka’s northernmost district and is often referred
                    to as ‘Crown’ of Karnataka.</p>

                <h4></h4>
                <p>The recorded history of the city goes back to the third century B.C. when it was a part of the Mauryan Empire. After Mauryas, Satavahanas, Kadambas, and Chalukyas of Badami reigned over Bidar territory. The Delhi Sultanate invaded the
                    area first by Allauddin Khilji, and later, Muhammed-bin-Tughluq took control of the entire Deccan. In the middle of the 14th century, the Sultan of Delhi's officers rebelled and this resulted in the establishment of Bahmanid Dynasty.</p><br>

                <p> The history of the present fort at Bidar is attributed to the sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah, the first sultan of the Bahmani dynasty to 1427 when he shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar since it had better climatic conditions and
                    was also a fertile and fruit-bearing land. The earliest recorded history of its existence as a small and robust fort is also traced to prince Ulugh Khan in 1322, whereafter it came under the reign of the Tughlaq dynasty.</p>

                <p> With the establishment of the Bahmanid dynasty (1347), Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah Bahmani. Bidar remained under the Barid Shahi dynasty until its conquest by the Bijapur Sultanate in 1619. He wrested the Bidar
                    Fort from the Adil Shahis after a 21-day war in 1656. With this, Bidar became a part of the Mughal dynasty for the second time. Bidar was made a subah (imperial top-level province) in 1656, which Telangana Subah was merged into the
                    next year.</p><br>
                <p>
                    In 1724, Bidar became a part of the Asaf Jahi Kingdom of the Nizams. Third son of Asaf Jah l (Nizam l) Mir Sa'id Muhammad Khan, Salabat Jang ruled from Bidar fort from 1751 to 1762, till his brother Mir Nizam Ali Khan Asaf Jah III imprisoned him in this
                    fort, and was killed in Bidar fort on 16 September 1763. It was connected to Hyderabad by rail in the early 20th century. After India's independence, in 1956 all Kannada-speaking areas were merged to form the Mysore State and Bidar
                    became part of the new Mysore (now Karnataka) state.
                </p>
                <p>The ancient Karez System in the city has been recently discovered. The Karez (Qanat) is an underground network of aqueducts for water supply. The Bidar Karez, built in the 15th century, is more than 3 km (1.9 mi) long with 21 air vents.
                    Underground canals, built to connect underground water streams, were meant to provide drinking water to civilian settlements and the garrison inside the Bidar fort. This was necessary for a city where the soil was rocky and drilling
                    wells was difficult.
