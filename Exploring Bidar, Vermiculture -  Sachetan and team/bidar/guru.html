            <h4>Gurudwara Nanak Jhira History</h4>
          
            <p>As and when this world is infested with sins, injustice, tyranny, cruelty and evil, God Almighty has sent some pious soul to this world to destroy the above forces, so that righteousness and truth may prevail. In other words, God himself takes birth in the form of some Saintly person. It is believed that Guru Nanak Devji Maharaj, the first Guru of the Sikhs was the incarnation of God. Before his birth all kinds of above evil forces were rampant in India.
<br><br>
                The situation in Punjab was even worse in those days. There was no sense of unity amongst Punjabis then. The invaders used to rock the country by looting, robbing, abducting girls and taking away the booty. At such a dark period, Guru Nanak Devji Maharaj appeared in this burning globe to preach love, equality, harmony, righteousness, service to humanity and truth.
                <br><br>
                Guru Nanak was born on Kartik Purnima 1526 Bikrami (i.e. 1469 A.D) at Talwandi Rai Bhoe, now known as Sri Nankana Saheb (now in Pakistan ) to Sri Mehta Kalu, a revenue Accountant, & Mata Triptaji.

                One of the very few Sikh pilgrimage centres in south India, the Guru Nanak Jhira Sahib nestles in serene surroundings near a splendid Gurudwara complex. A natural spring feeds the Sarovara (lake) built here. A Guru-ka-langar (community kitchen) provides free food to all visitors. According to a legend Guru Nanak, the famed social and religious Sikh reformer had visited Bidar while the land was in the grip of a famine. At the request of locals, Guru Nanak performed a miracle to bring about a spring of water from the laterite rock mountain. Till this day, crystal clear water flows from here. It is believed that drinking this water cures many ailments.
