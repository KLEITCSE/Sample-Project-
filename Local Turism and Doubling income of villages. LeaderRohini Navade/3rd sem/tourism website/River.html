        <h3>Kali River</h3>
        <p>The Kali River in Dandeli is one of the most beautiful places to visit in Karnataka because of the myriad activities that tourists can enjoy near it. It is not only the perfect place to spend an adventure-filled weekend but also an incredible sight-seeing spot in Karnataka, if you like spending time in the midst of nature.</p>
       <p>
        It is known for its lush green jungles that fringe the banks of the river, as well as the dams that are located on the river to create the famous backwaters of Karnataka. The river starts at a small village called Kushavali in the mountain ranges of the Western Ghats and flows into the Supa Dam, where it is met by another famous river- Pandri. The river flows for a total distance of 184km before it finally meets the Arabian Sea.
        </p>
        <p>The freshwater of the Kali River meanders through endless stretches of lush green vegetation over beautiful rock formations that make it ideal for sports like river rafting. The river, which is otherwise rather peaceful and quiet, suddenly transforms into a rush of white eddies as the river bed drops 10-20 feet near Dandeli, and then settles back into its peaceful pace.</p>
        <p>There are several dams, forts, temples and forests along the river, but the adventure camp in Dandeli is one of the primary attractions of the Kali River. The camp organizes adventure sports and activities such as river rafting, canoeing, kayaking, birdwatching, trekking, hiking and nature walks, which makes for an ideal vacation for nature lovers and adventure enthusiasts.
