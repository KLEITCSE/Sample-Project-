    The temple is dedicated to Lord Mahalingeshwara, built in the Kalyani Chalukyan 
    style, faces the cotton mill and flanks one side of the gorge. Locally known as 
    Tarakeshwara temple, the temple boasts of a huge courtyard and has a sanctum 
    sanctorum over which looms a tower that is adorned with exquisite carvings.
    About Kalyani Chalukyan style 
    The basic floor plan is defined by the size of the shrine, the size of the 
    sanctum, the distribution of the building mass, and by the pradakshina (path for 
    circumambulation), if there is one.
    Architectural articulation refers to the ornamental components that give shape 
    to the outer wall of the shrine. These include projections, recesses, and 
    representations that can produce a variety of patterns and outlines, either 
    stepped, stellate (star-shaped), or square.[21] If stepped (also called "stepped 
    diamond of projecting corners"), these components form five or seven 
    projections on each side of the shrine, where all but the central one are 
    projecting corners (projections with two full faces created by two recesses, left 
    and right, that are at right angles with each other).</div>
