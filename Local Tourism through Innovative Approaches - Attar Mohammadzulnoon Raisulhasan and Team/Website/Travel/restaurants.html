Hanging bridge, Mahalingeshwar temple, Heritage buildings of Gokak Mills are the various other attractions at this spot.
Tourists come here in large numbers during Rainy season, Sundays and other holidays. Itâ€™s a good picnic spot as there is a garden and established viewpoints to have splendid look of the waterfalls.
Great place to visit to spend seeing the big waterfall. During rainy seasons the water levels swell up and flow is also quite forceful and speedy, so care must be exercised. Water falling from about 70 metre height in to the gorge make it beautiful and enormous. It can get crowdy at most times and care must be exercised at all times as there is no rails for protection and water flow is unstoppable.
