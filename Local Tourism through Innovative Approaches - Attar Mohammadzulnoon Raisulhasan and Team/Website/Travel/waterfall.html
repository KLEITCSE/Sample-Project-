text-decoration: none;"> Gokak Falls is 6 km away from Gokak town and gets its name from the Goki trees found in abundance in these areas. It resembles the Niagara Falls due to its features like the fall, shape etc. Here, River Ghataprabha takes a leap of 52 metres over the sand-stone cliff amidst a picturesque gorge of the rugged valley, making a beautiful sight. This place has the credit of generating electricity for the first time in the country in about 1887. A prime attraction of the Gokak Falls is the hanging 200-m-long bridge that lies 14 m above the bedrock. Tourists can also visit monuments on both sides of the rocky gorge which include temples of Goddess Durga, Lord Shanmukha and Lord Mahalingeshwara built in the traditional Chalukyan style of architecture.</div>
