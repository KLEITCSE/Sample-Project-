<h5>"The Cradle of Hindu Rock Architecture"</h5>

<p style="font-size: 20px">Home to over 125 beautiful Chalukyan temples and monuments, Aihole is a historical site in Bagalkot, Karnataka. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site and is surrounded by marvellous sandstone hills and villages on the banks of the Malaprabha River. It was formerly the capital of the Chalukya Dynasty with over 100 Hindu and Jain temples dating back to around 6th to 12th century. Excavation and investigation into the history of Aihole continues and several thousand tourists seek out the serene and spiritual ambiance of this city every year. </br></br>

Aihole, known initially as Ayyavole or Aryapura, played a significant role in Hindu mythology. Among the numerous temples scattered in Aihole, the most noteworthy among them is the Durga Temple composed of a semicircular apse, an elevated plinth and a gallery encircling the sanctum. The Lad Khan Temple is one of the earliest temples in the region and was initially a royal assembly hall and marriage mantapa. It was the chosen abode of the Muslim chief Lad Khan. Other major attractions in the area are the Huchimalli Temple with a sculpture of Lord Vishnu sitting atop a cobra, the Ravalphadi Cave Temple which celebrates the various incarnations of Lord Shiva, the Konti Temple Complex, the Umamaheswari Temple, the Jain Meguti Temple, and the two-storied Buddhist temple.</p>

<h5>History</h5>
<p style="font-size: 20px">There's an interesting story about how the town got the name. Legend has it that Lord Parashurama, after avenging the death of his father, Sage Jamadagni came to the river Malaprabha to wash his battle axe and bloodstained hands. While doing so, the blood turned the colour of the river water to red. Seeing this horrifying sight, a woman screamed ‘Ayyo Hole!’ in Kannada, which translates to 'Oh no! Blood!’. Thus, this town got the name Aihole. However, this place is also called ‘Ayyavole’ and ‘Aryapura’.
</br></br>

Aihole has great significance to the Ramayana in the Rishi Gautama and the Ahilya part in the epic. In the town, there exists an axe-shaped rock with a foot imprint on it. These prints are said to have belonged to Parashurama.
