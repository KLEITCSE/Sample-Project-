<p style="font-size: 20px">At a distance of 35 km from Aihole, Kudalasangama is a pilgrimage site in the Bagalkot district of Karnataka. At the confluence of Krishna and Malaprabha Rivers, it is one of the popular places to visit in Aihole.

</br></br> Kudalasangama is famous for 850 years old Sangameswara temple, known as Kudala Sangameswara dedicated to Lord Shiva. Built-in 12th century, the temple is situated on the banks of the Krishna River and it was renovated several times. The temple is constructed in Dravidian style with a large temple tower at the entrance, followed by the main temple with a porch, navaranga and sanctum. The door frame of the garbhagriha is richly carved with floral designs and animal figures.

</br></br> In front of the temple, amid the river, is a small stone mandapa with a Shivalinga in it, and lofty cement concrete dry well has been built around it to protect it from submersion. The sikhara of the temple is a typical South Indian-style structure. The temple has inscriptions dating back to 1160 AD and 1213 AD.

</br></br> This place is also associated with famous saint Vishwaguru Basavanna, a great devotee of Lord Shiva and the founder of the powerful Lingayat faith. His samadhi is at Kudalasangama.

</br></br> Other places of interest in Kudalasangama include Campus of the Basava Dharma Peetha, a Sabha Bhavana with 6000 seating capacity, Basava Gopura - a 200 feet tall symmetrical tower, and a museum. The famous Almatti Dam is located at a distance of 15 km from Koodalasangama.</p>
